# Algorithm Design Techniques
The *Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization* on Coursera teaches various ways to develop and design algorithms. This repo is a collection of algorithms I have developed by one of these techniques.

## Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms work by choosing a safe step and repeating the safe step till the problem is solved.

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms
These algorithms divide the problem into smaller **non-overlapping** sub-problems. The base case of these sub-problems is usually the most obvious solution for the smallest input. MergeSort is an example.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a mathematical approach for breaking down the given problem into smaller **overlapping** sub-problems. The way to this approach is to develop a brute force solution and then optimize it using one of these techniques:

### Memoization
Cache the output of the recursive function for given set of *changing* inputs.

### Tabulation
Creates a table in memory and computes the result iteratively. The next larger result is computed using the previously computed smaller results.


## Classic Algorithmic Problems
The following algorithms were covered in the course material:
- Discrete Knapsack
- Fractional Knapsack
- (More soon..)
